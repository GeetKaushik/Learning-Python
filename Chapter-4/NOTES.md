# Chapter - 4 : Lists and Tuples

## In this chapter we will learn about list and tuples

### `Lists`
- `lists` are containers to store set of any values od any data type.
  - Example: 
  ```
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars"]
    numbers = [1,2,3,4]
  ```
- `lists` are mutable
- `lists` are made by using `[]` brackets

### `Tuples`
- `tuples` are similar as lists but they are immutable like `Strings`
  - Example: 
    ```
    vowels = ('a','e','i','o','u')
    ```
- `tuples` are made by using `()` brackets
