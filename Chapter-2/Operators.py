# Operators

## Arthmatic Operators

a = 1 
b = 2

print( a + b ) # Addition
print( a - b ) # Subtraction
print( a * b ) # Multiplication
print( a / b ) # Division

print("="*50)

## Assignment Operators

c = 1 # assignment operator, It assigns the value to variable
print ( c )
c += 1
print ( c ) # Increment assignment operator, It increases the value of already defined variable by the value specified and assign it 
c -= 1
print ( c ) # Decrement assignment operator, It decreases the value of already defined variable by the value specified and assign it
c *= 2 #multipy by 2 and assign it 
c /= 2 # divide by 2 and assign it
#etc...
print("="*50)

## Comparison operators
# : Returns a boolean value depending on the result of comparison

d = 1
e = 2
print( d == e ) # equivalent 
print( d != e ) # Not equivalent 
print( d > e ) # greater than 
print( d >= e ) # greater than equal to 
print( d < e ) # less than
print( d <= e ) # less than equal to 
print("="*50)

## Logical operators

print (True and True) # and operator, if both is True than the result is True else False
print (True or False) # or operator, if anyone is True than the result is True else False
print (not True) # not operator, it switches to True to False and False to True
print("="*50)
