# Chapter - 2 : Variables and Datatype

## In this chapter we learn about variables and datatypes in python

- `Variable` : It is a name given to a memory location in a program. It is a container to store data in it.

- `Keywords` : They are reserved words in python such as `return`,`def`,`true`,`false`, etc.

- `Datatypes` : As the name suggest type of data stored in variable. In Python there are following data types :-
  - Integer
  - Floating point numbers
  - Strings
  - Booleans
  - None

### Rules for defining a variable name

- A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores.
- A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscores.
- A variable name can't start with a digit.
- No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.

### Operators in Python

1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, \*, / etc.
2. Assignment operators: =, +=, -= etc.
3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <, != etc.
4. Logical operators: and, or, not.

### TypeCasting

type() function is used to find the data type of a given variable in python.

Converting a variable datatype to another varible datatype is called Typecasting. 

### Taking input from user

input() function is used to take input from user.
