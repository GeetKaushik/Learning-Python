#? The game() function in a program lets a user play a game and returns the score as an integer. You need to read a file 'Hi-score.txt' which is either blank or contains the previous Hi-score. You need to write a progtam to update the Hi-score whenever the game() function breaks the Hi-score.

  rolls = []
  for i in range(n):

  score = sum(rolls)
