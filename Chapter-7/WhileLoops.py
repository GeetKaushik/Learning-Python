# While loops

# a = 0

# do...while loop is not present in python as it is 
# but we can achieve it like this

# b = 1
# while True: # Here due to while True it will always go in the loop
#   print("Hello", b)
#   b += 1
#   if b >= 5: break # using if and break we can control the loop and exit it
